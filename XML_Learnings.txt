Certain characters are not allowed in XML.  If I want to have one of the following characters in the data portion of an XML entity.

"   &quot;	
&   &amp;
'   &apos;
<   &lt;
>   &gt;

So putting a < between my names would look like:
    
    <firstName>Tom&lt;Mitchell</firstName>

The other option is what is called CDATA.  The format is:

    <![CDATA[
        This is CDATA.  Any thing within these brackets will be treated as regular text and not markup.
    ]]>
