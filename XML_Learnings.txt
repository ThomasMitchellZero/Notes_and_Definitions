--Special Characters

    Certain characters are not allowed in XML.  If I want to have one of the following characters in the data portion of an XML entity.

    "   &quot;	
    &   &amp;
    '   &apos;
    <   &lt;
    >   &gt;

    So putting a < between my names would look like:
        
        <firstName>Tom&lt;Mitchell</firstName>

    The other option is what is called CDATA.  The format is:

        <![CDATA[
            This is CDATA.  Any thing within these brackets will be treated as regular text and not markup.
        ]]>

--XML Schema
    An XML Schema document is an XML file that is like a contract that determines the terms of information sharing between XML files.  (not sure what that means, so will expand when I understand).  The format is .xsd

    Looks like data can have three different types, and these are defined in the schema.
        -Inbuilt types - types that have been defined by the language.  They are things like integers, strings, decimals, dates, etc.
        -Simple types - inbuilt types, but with conditions.  (AFAICT, all conditions are built into the language? )
        -Complex types - elements that can have other elements inside them? Also elements that have attributes.
