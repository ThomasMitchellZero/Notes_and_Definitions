Advice from Dave:
    -Having no UI5 experience is OK.  If I stretch the truth too much they are going to wonder why I'm looking for a junior position with 4 years of experience.

    -Things with "junior" in the title are good because that implies that there's a "senior" somewhere around there.

    -Face-to-face work is best because that's how you build a network.

    -It's not critical to have work to show.  He has never shown anything in most of his interviews.
