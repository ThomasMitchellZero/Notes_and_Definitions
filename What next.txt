-I am in trouble here.  I've had a few bad sessions in a row, and I think it's because I don't have a clearly-defined mid-level goal.  

0-level goal: make money programming
1-level goal: Build a portfolio to develop my skills and have something to show.

2- Here's where I am stuck.  I need to come up with some projects that I would like to show.  

A) Basic business app.  What functions should I fulfill?

    Add/remove business expenses
    Chart business expenses




B) Legrand user-feedback app.


    User side:

    Drag-boxes to rank concepts
    Comment section
    Multiple-choice section?
    Save results to a database.
    output the data as .xls file
    Rank according to different attributes?
    
    Web hosting





    Tester side:

    Login
    Create new test
    

It is 9:45 on 1 June and I am quite stuck.  I am getting error messages and I don't really know what to do about them.  


-Figure out how to run my application on a server.

    -Advantages 
        - I need to learn how to do this anyways
        - Would allow me to ask Harrison for help?
        - Maybe would eliminate the CORS errors?
    -Disadvantages
        - Would take a lot of time
        - Not sure it would solve the problem?


-Try to clone the example application EXACTLY.  Also, add in sections piece by piece and see where the error messages occur.  This app seems pretty similar to the main practice app I produced.  Somewhere in hi_world, I did something different to prevent me from having these issues.

    Advantages
        -Seems pretty fast
        -
    Disadvantages
        - If it doesn't work, what have I learned? 
        - 

-Try to make an application with nested views


From what I can figure out, components appear to be more complex than controls. AFAICT components are meant to be shared between MULTIPLE applications, while controls are meant to be shared within ONE application.

So it looks like controls are what I want.

It also looks like the difference between composite controls and regular controls is that composite controls ONLY use existing controls, whereas regular controls can actually generate new HTML.

Here is my situation.  I've pretty much reached the end of the UI5 classes.

OPTIONS:

    -Take the newer, more recent course on OpenSAP

    -Try a different course?

    -Try to identify gaps in my knowledge and try to fill them myself.

//////////// 30 NOV 2019  //////////////////////////

Well, here I am.  Still stuck.  I think a big part of the reason why I WANT to dive into the UX project is because I have a clear idea of what I want to build.  For UI5, I really have no objective, and thus I have no drive.

First question - if Harrison does not kick me work, how will I learn?
    -The problem is that most UI5 developer roles seem to want people who know a LOT of stuff, like Node and such.  

    -Even with UI5, I really have no idea what is good and what isn't.  What I really want is to work as a junior developer under the umbrella of someone who really knows their shit.  I can get help if I am stuck, and the project won't fail if I have 95% of the required knowledge and not 100%.

    -Now, there may be roles like that out there.  That part is not impossible.  I might need to fish for a while until I can find the right role, but if I am going to do that, I will need a few demo projects.

    -If Harrison comes through: 
    Everything is good.  I hit pause on the UX design, work on UI5, and hopefully get over the hump with the benefit of real-world experience and someone to ask questions.

    -If he does not - U15:
    I continue to muddle through.  I build a few sample apps, and fish for opportunities to work as a junior.  If I have a UX portfolio, maybe that helps me land a job?  Like - I don't have all the skills for this job, but I have adjacent skills that are useful?

    -If he does not - UX:
    I fish for UX jobs until I find one I like.  From there, I'm in regular contact with developers.  Maybe I can leverage that and eventually grow into a developer role?

    Honestly, right now I feel like the UX work is the play.  If I can work with Harrison, I'll quickly speed past any progress I would make on my own.  If I can't, I feel like I've got a much better shot at landing a UX role than a UI5 role.  UX for the rest of the day.
