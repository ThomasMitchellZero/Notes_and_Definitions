--what does JSON mean? JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation, and it's just a 
    format for calling out the key:value pairs of an object (much like what the CSV format is to tables)

    name {
    key1: "value1",
    key2: "value2"
    }

--What is V8 and what does it do?  
    V8 is a C++ program that takes Javascript code and translates it into machine code.

--what is Node.js?  
    Node.JS is a C++ program that incorporates V8 and its JS > machine code functionality.  However, it also
    allows you to perform a lot of additional actions that JS does not contain.  For instance, you can just
    type Require into your JS code like it's a built-in method and JS will process it without trouble.

--What is nodemon?   It is a program for node that constantly checks
the source for any changes and then restarts the server automatically.
Using it feels liek any changes you make to the source code are
reflected in the app in real time.  If I add an <h1> to an HTML page,
it appears almost instantly with no need for me to manually restart.


-- Execution Stack:  When Javascript runs, operations in the main code are executed
in sequential order.  When a function is encountered, it moves to the top of the 
execution queue and is resolved first - before the program moves on.  If there are
nested functions, the most deeply-nested is executed first.  It's just like Magic -
last in, first out.

-- Hoisting:  Hoisting occurs in every execution context (spell on the stack) 
After an execution context is stacked but before it is executed, JS runs through
it and makes a couple things available immediately.  Declared functions (but not
function expressions) are available at ANY point in the execution of the context.  
Variables are all also declared, but their values are all set to Undefined
and they aren't re-set to the value the programmer wants until they are reached
during exection of the current execution object. So consider:

var age = 23
function foo(){
    console.log(age);  
    var age = 65;
    console.log(age);
}

foo();

this will log:
Undefined
65



-- functions:
function declaration:

function foo(bar){}

function expression:
var foo = function(bar){}

difference between the two is that a function declaration is hoisted (made available
for use before the program is executed) while a function expression is not.  So it 
sounds like I need a pretty good reason to use a function declaration because a
function expression prevents me from executing a function that is declared below 
where that function is called.  It makes the code more readable.

This should be installed as a dev dependency by using the -D suffix
to the NPM CLI install (i.e npm -D nodemon)



AFAICT, when starting a new Node application we need to run   npm init from
the CLI.  It definitely creates the package.json file for me.  Not sure
if it does anything else.

--What is an object? 
    An object is just a set of name-value pairs.  The values can be 
    primitives, or they can be other objects, like methods. In JS
    objects are the contents of curly braces {}

What is a method? 
    a method is just a named function that is part of an object.
    Remember that objects are just collections of key:value pairs,
    so 

What is a primitive? - A primitive is a value with no other features.  Things like strings, numbers, 
    and booleans are primitives.  Objects and methods are not.  It might just be anything that doesn't
    contain an operator?

module.exports =   
     so I just now understood the form of this.  Module is an object.  Exports is a property 
    of that object, specifically a property that makes the value it contains available to the Require method.
    Require takes a parameter (the file path) and returns whatever value has been assigned to 
    the Exports key of the Module object in the JS file it finds there.

Event Listener:
    A name for code that runs in response to the occurance of a particular
    event.  I believe they take the event as one parameter?

Object Literal: An object you make and populate by hand.  For instance,

var cats = {
    cat1: bubu,
    cat2: Sorin,
};

object constructor = a function that is a template for a new object. When
you call the function in the future, the parameters you pass it will be
assigned to their appropriate keys and values.  This is used if you expect
to make a lot of objects with the same set of properties.

For instance:

function cats(name, age, color){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.color = color;
}

const versus var

const means that the variable can't be reassigned.  This acutally 
seems like what I want in most cases, like if I'm requiring an
outside module.  Plus, once it's assigned you just call the name
the same way you would if it were a var.

Something new I discovered.  It is true that a constant cannot be
reassigned.  However, the values it contains can be altered.

.prototype method = Normally, you can't make changes to an object constructor
function on the fly. If you want another property, you have to add it into
the constructor function before the code is run.  The .prototype method
allows you to bend that rule.

Something else interesting about prototypes.  If I use the .prototype method to
change an object, such as:  

Walk.prototype.speed = "fast";

All of Walk's child objects will get the property of .speed and the value of
"fast" but Walk itself remains unchanged (I think.)

9.22.8:47pm

Here's my best explanation right now.  Children don't automatically inherit ANYTHING
from their parents.  Only members specified with the .prototype function
are passed on.

Template literal - a way to concatenate strings in Javascript.  (more needed)
This is a new feature in ES6.  Basically, you use back ticks `` instead of 
'' quotes to enclose a statement and wrap variables in ${} and then you don't
have to do a bunch of plus signs.  Not sure this is better, but here's an example:

var name = "John Doe";
var greet2 = `I shot ${name}`;

--

A name-value pair in an object is called a 'member'

--

Instantiation is when you create an object instance from a class.

--

libuv is a library within Node.JS.  It deals with events coming from
lower levels in the machine, like opening a file.

Lib UV runs something called the Event Loop, in which it is constantly
checking for events from the operating system.  When an event is
detected, it is placed into a queue, and this usually happens when the
event completes.

When the event is complete, libuv runs a callback function.  That function
usually results in Javascript code running in response.

--

An abstract class (also called a base class) is a type of object you 
never work directly with.  You can only inherit from it.

--

Chaining is when a method returns an object that can have another method
called on it right then.  In many cases, the method returns the parent object
which is technically called cascading.  

looks like object.method1().method2().method3();

--

An API is a set of URLs that accept and send data.  Sounds like in the
API model, all of the data-processing is done off-world on the URL host
server.  So a site might an input phrase and give me back the same phrase
in Spanish, but I would have no access to the process by which they did it.

APIs are usually a series of URLs, one for each function.  An individual
URL within an API is called an 'endpoint'.  

APIs give and receive data in multiple formats, and the most popular is
JSON.

--

Serialization - means to convert a JS object into a format that can be
transferred.  JSON and CSV are two examples.  'Deserialization' is the
inverse; it translates the formatted data back into a JS object.

GitHub repositories:

Here's an example of the code you run to get link to an online respository

git remote add origin https://github.com/ThomasMitchellZero/Gitty-The-First.git
git push -u origin master.

--HTTP Request

This is a text file generated by the browser that goes to the server
and lets the server know what to send back.  More to come, but it has
a head and a body.

--

HTTP Method:  HTTP is not HTML.  HTTP methods specify the "type" of
request coming from the client (the browser) to the server.  Not to be
confused with a "response" which is when the server talks back to
the client.  

HTTP methods are also called HTTP verbs, and they are things like
GET, POST, DELETE, etc.  The verbs come along with the rest of 
the HTTP request, and the server treats requests differently based on
what type of verb it receives.

For instance, a GET request is asking the server to just send some
information (like an HTML file) while a POST request is telling the
server to incorporate some information coming from the client, like 
the contents of a form.  

One other interesting detail: GET and POST requests can both have queries,
but in a GET the query string is in the head, while in a POST it is in
the body of the req.  Not sure if this is a universal.

POST reqs can also contain JSON objects in the body, not just strings.  
The Content-Type section of the req header is where you specify what
the body of the POST will contain.

--

Middleware is software that intermediates between two layers of
software.   AFAICT, in the case of a Node server, the first layer
is the browser generating the request, the second layer is
the Node application generating the response, and the middleware is 
Express?  If I am correct, Express is taking the incoming stream from
the broswer, changing it, and then passing on that changed version to
the application running in Node.


--

Express:  Not sure exactly what Express is, but it is a framework for
web apps.  It simplifies routing (what to send as a response to a request
for a particular URL)  

Also of note: Express has to be installed separately on the top-level
folder of any new app.

--

Static Files: Files that are not processed by the code in any way.
AFAICT, this means that the files are not changed.  If the client
requests the contents of a text file, I don't process that text file.
I just send it on its way.  

Requests DO NOT automatically connect to files.  I need to specifically
tell the program what to do when a request for a file comes in.

--

Template Engines: these are utilities for Express that take text and
translate it into the HTML that will be delivered to the client via
the server response.  Once you have installed your template engine 
(EJS in this case) you can create individual web pages as .ejs files
rather than .html files.  EJS (or whatever template engine you are using)
will then translate your EJS file into an HTML file before sending it 
as a response.

--

REST - Stands for REpresentational State Transfer, and it is an 
architectural style for building APIs.  I don't really get this one
because I don't know enough about the alternatives, but the gist
seems to be that you structure your API in such a way that the 
different HTTP verbs correspond to the function you are performing.

Each request from client to server must contain  all the information
necessary to understand that request, and can't use any stored context on 
the server.  

For instance, I think POST does everything that GET does.  Even if a page
has no interaction whatsoever, you can still render it with POST.  
But because GET exists to handle non-interactive HTTP requests, you're 
not being RESTful if you use POST instead. 

Is this bad for any reason other than legibility?

///  DATABASES ///

-- Relational databases:  AFAICT, the best way to make a relational database
is to have EVERYTHING have a unique identifier and a value.  So you have a 
table of key:name pairs, a table of key: address pairs, and a table of
key:email pairs.  The actual tables, called Relational Databases,  used are 
then assembled from links to the relevant keys.  This way, there is only every
a single source of truth for each value.  Changing an email on the main table
changes it everywhere.  Data that does not repeat itself unnecessarily is 
called "well-normalized".

The advantage of doing it this way is that you don't need an entry for every
key-value pair.  If there's no entry for person.height, you just get back
"Undefined".  (but is this really a problem with tables?) 

+ How do objects allow you to change data structures on the fly in a way
that tables do not?  

Data model - the structure of the database.  If you have three tables and
each table has ten fields, that is your record.

--
What are Promises and how do they work?

--

Postman is a desktop application that allows you to simulate requests to a
server.  You can send different types, like GET or POST.  AFAICT this allows
us to see if an API is working without having to actually build the front-end  
first.

Encryption and hashing.  Encryption is used when a message needs to be encoded
and then decoded again.  Hashing is used when the message
never needs to be decoded, which is perfect for passwords.

Here's the situation.  Many users use the same name and password.  If your DB is
breached and passwords are stored in the clear, hackers could then use that info
to get into all your other websites.

Hashing solves this problem.  Hashing is an algorithm that takes a given input
and turns it into a string of gibberish, with two key features.  First, as long
as the input is the same, the algorithm will always generate the same string
of gibberish.  Second, there's no systematic way to guess the input from the 
output, even if you know what the hashing algorithm is.

It's made even more difficult by salt.  Salting adds some random characters
to your input to make it even harder to guess from the outside.

So when you enter your password for the first time, it gets hashed and the
gibberish is stored on the site's server.  Any time you go to log in, your
password is passed to the same algorithm, and it outputs the same string
of gibberish it did the last time.  THAT is what is compared to the gibberish
string in the database.  If hackers crack the database, they'll have access
to your gibberish string (and your account on that site) but because they have
no way of guessing the input that generated it, they can't get into any other
accounts.

-Promise.  I don't know much about it but it seems to be important.  

What exactly is a DOM?-
